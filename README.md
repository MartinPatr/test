New York City: The Financial Hub of the world setting standards across North America. Here commercial landlords are already paying over $200 million a year in fines under Local Law 97 — a regulation that penalizes large buildings for exceeding carbon performance limits.

 So when Local Law 97 starts biting, it's not just someone else's problem — it's our risk exposure, our loan performance on the line.

“Thankfully that's just New York…”

[Sound effect: sharp slap — new speaker steps in]

These policy slaps? They’re fast, unexpected, and everywhere.

Toronto is on track to implement Building Emissions Performance Standards later this year.  

Vancouver is launching carbon caps for commercial buildings starting in 2026. 

Boston and Washington, D.C. already have enforceable emissions limits.

Even the building we’re in right now — WaterPark Place, one of the most energy-efficient buildings in Ontario — would still face over $1 million in annual fines if Local Law 97 were applied here today. And that’s before accounting for rising carbon pricing and escalating energy costs.

Now imagine lending money to 20,000 WaterPark Places.

That’s the magnitude of exposure RBC is sitting on — over $166 billion in commercial real estate loans. Based on conservative scenario modeling, our clients could collectively lose more than $11 billion over the next 10 to 15 years. Even if just  1% of that exposure defaults — RBC could be looking at over $500 million in credit losses.

And right now, we have no standardized system to assess which of those assets are exposed. - No tooling to benchmark retrofit risk. - No visibility into how new policies will impact borrower performance or loan value.

Meanwhile, policy is accelerating — city by city, building by building — and our teams are flying blind.

That’s why we built ARC — a transition risk intelligence platform designed to quantify the unknown.

ARC gives RBC the ability to model risk, as the cost of doing nothing isn't zero — it's hundreds of millions.
